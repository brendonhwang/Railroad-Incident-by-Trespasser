# Railroad Serious Incident Caused by Trespasser

### Number of Incidents and Causalities
According to data from the National Response Center (NRC), there were over 7,000 railroad incidents caused by trespassers between 2017 and 2021, resulting in 5,417 serious incidents*. These serious incidents include 4,245 fatalities and 1,785 injuries in the United States. Over the five years, the year with the highest number of serious incidents was 2019, recording 1,215 incidents, while the lowest was in 2020 with 975 incidents. Despite fluctuations, the overall trend remains consistent. The data underscores the pervasive issue of trespassing on U.S. railroads. 
Analyzing factors such as location, time, and reasons for trespassing may provide valuable insights for developing solutions to mitigate the number of incidents.

### Highest Number of Serious Incidents by States
California experienced the highest number of serious incidents caused by trespassers between 2017 and 2021. However, there was a notable decrease from 252 serious incidents in 2017 to 190 serious incidents in 2021. In contrast, New York, the state with the second-highest number of serious incidents caused by trespassers, saw an increase from 72 in 2017 to 119 in 2021. Intriguingly, only 9% of these incidents involved vehicles at the crossing.

Texas and Illinois ranked as the fourth and fifth states with the highest number of serious incidents caused by trespassers during the same period. Surprisingly, over 48% of serious incidents in both states were associated with vehicles at the crossing.

### Vehicle Involved in Grade Cross Incident

Between 2017 and 2021, there were 1,946 railroad incidents caused by trespassers on the East Coast, with 14% of these incidents involving vehicles at crossings. 
Concurrently, the West Coast exhibited comparable trends, recording 1,171 incidents during the same period, of which 12% were associated with vehicles at crossings.

Between 2017 and 2021, the Midwest experienced 1,197 railroad incidents caused by trespassers, with 34% of these incidents involving vehicles at crossings. 
During the same period, the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions exhibited similar trends, recording 614 and 182 incidents, respectively, with 34% involving vehicles at crossings.

### Incident Timeline

The data suggests that over 60% of incidents occurred between nighttime and morning hours. Notably, the type of trespasser during this period seems to differ. 
The data indicates a higher frequency of incidents happening during the night to morning timeframe.

### Final Thoughts
** Analyze More Data: **
Incidents on the East and West Coasts were linked to individuals trespassing on railroads, while other regions experienced incidents involving vehicles at crossings. A significant portion (over 31%) of incidents occurred in the morning, between 5 am to noon. Further data is required to identify trespassers during the night and early morning hours. Surprisingly, the season does not seem to have an impact. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of root causes, there is a necessity to collect demographic, age, and additional data, as these factors may play crucial roles.

** Detection Real Time: **
As per the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, the utilization of fixed cameras equipped with built-in artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities enables the development of tools for identifying trespassing 'hot spots' and enhancing trespass detection. This can lead to the implementation of improved safety measures such as fencing, grade separation for pedestrians, and the implementation of Train GPA (Geographical Positioning System) systems.

** Government Regulation:  **
To address trespassing issues, it is recommended to enforce trespassing laws and consider hiring private security to patrol specific railroad hot spot areas. According to criminal traffic laws, trespassing on railroad property is typically categorized as a misdemeanor. Penalties for such offenses may range from fines of $100 to $1,000, along with the possibility of jail time, contingent on state regulations. Implementing measures to enforce the law and enhance security can contribute to mitigating trespassing incidents and ensuring the safety of the railroad premises.

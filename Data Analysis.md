According to data from the National Response Center (NRC), there were over 7,000 railroad incidents caused by trespassers between 2017 and 2021, resulting in 5,417 serious incidents*. These serious incidents include 4,245 fatalities and 1,785 injuries in the United States. Over the five-year period, the year with the highest number of serious incidents was 2019, recording 1,215 incidents, while the lowest was in 2020 with 975 incidents. Despite fluctuations, the overall trend remains consistent. The data underscores the pervasive issue of trespassing on U.S. railroads. 
Analyzing factors such as location, time, and reasons for trespassing may provide valuable insights for developing solutions to mitigate the number of incidents.


California experienced the highest number of serious incidents caused by trespassers between 2017 and 2021. However, there was a notable decrease from 252 serious incidents in 2017 to 190 serious incidents in 2021. In contrast, New York, the state with the second-highest number of serious incidents caused by trespassers, saw an increase from 72 in 2017 to 119 in 2021. Intriguingly, only 9% of these incidents involved vehicles at the crossing.

Texas and Illinois ranked as the fourth and fifth states with the highest number of serious incidents caused by trespassers during the same period. Surprisingly, over 48% of serious incidents in both states were associated with vehicles at the crossing.


Between 2017 and 2021, there were 1,946 railroad incidents caused by trespassers on the East Coast, with 14% of these incidents involving vehicles at crossings. 
Concurrently, the West Coast exhibited comparable trends, recording 1,171 incidents during the same period, of which 12% were associated with vehicles at crossings.

Between 2017 and 2021, the Midwest experienced 1,197 railroad incidents caused by trespassers, with 34% of these incidents involving vehicles at crossings. 
During the same period, the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions exhibited similar trends, recording 614 and 182 incidents, respectively, with 34% involving vehicles at crossings.

The data suggests that over 60% of incidents occurred between nighttime and morning hours. Notably, the type of trespasser during this period seems to differ. 
The data indicates a higher frequency of incidents happening during the night to morning timeframe.
